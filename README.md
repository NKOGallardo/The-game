My Goals with This Game:
🎯 Fun & Engaging: I wanted a game that anyone can play, whether for a quick break or as a challenge.
🧠 Encourages Critical Thinking: Players must analyze feedback and refine their guesses.
⏳ Adds Excitement with a Timer: The countdown adds just the right amount of challenge.
🎶 Relaxing Atmosphere: With soft piano music, the game feels calming rather than stressful.

Whether you're playing to challenge yourself or just passing the time, I hope you enjoy this little game as much as I enjoyed making it! 😊
